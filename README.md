This is LINNEAZ!. The point is simple: make your oponent crash into your trail, or the world border.

THE MODES:
  BLITZ! mode:
    Both players move simultaneously, one with the WASD, the other one with IJKL. In this mode, it's common to see massive amounts of chaos and confusion, so remember to keep calm even in the heat of battle (i am not        responsible for loss of friends while using this product).
  TURNS mode:
    This mode is a lot more peacefull. It's basically the same as in blitz, but while one player moves, the other one's controlls are blocked.
